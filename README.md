# Modular JS Exercises and Examples# 

## Warmup ##

There is a simple warm up exercise found in the `/warmup` folder. 

NPM install to install dependencies:

```
npm install
```

And then start to run the built-in server

```
npm start
```

## ES6 Exercises ##

Work through the exercises in `/es6`
Solving and converting to ES6 syntax

Test by simply running the script through node:

```
node es6/1-block-scope
```

Or copy & past into jsFiddle

## TTW App - Time to weekend ##

The `ttw-app-base` folder has the starting point for the grunt setup exercises.

This branch is the ideal start point, though master should be good, too:

`timer-app-start-point` or `master`

There are a few additional branches you can view that have alternative  approaches to modules

* `timer-app-grunt-and-require-js`
* `timer-app-grunt-basic`
* `timer-app-grunt-iife`
* `timer-app-parcel-bundler`
* `timer-app-webpack`

## ToDo App ##

For our final lab we'll build out a ToDo application using ES6 syntax and modules.

The todo app exists in `/todo-app-base` where all the HTML and css if you prefer not to write that yourself.

The best branch to start from is:

`todo-app-start-point` or `master`

We'll rely on a task runner and some transformation tools to help us take care of business.

* Task Runner: Grunt? NPM? Gulp?
* Bundler: Parcel? Webpack?
* Transpiler: Babel - but, with Grunt or Webpack?

Other branches related to this project are:

* `todo-app-wip`
