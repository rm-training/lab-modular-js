Modular JS Exercises and Examples

1. Warmup (On Fiddle)

2. ES6 Exercises

	Work through the exercises in /es6
	Solving and converting to ES6 syntax

	Test by simply running the script through node:

		$> node 1-block-scope

	Or copy & past into jsFiddle

3. TTW App - Time to weekend

	The ttw-app-base folder has the starting point for the grunt setup exercises.

	This branch is the ideal start point, though master should be good, too:

		timer-app-start-point

	There are a few additional branches you can view that have alternative  approaches to modules

		- timer-app-grunt-and-require-js
		- timer-app-grunt-basic
		- timer-app-grunt-iife
		- timer-app-parcel-bundler
		- timer-app-webpack

4. ToDo App

	For our final lab we'll build out a ToDo application using ES6 syntax and modules.

	We'll rely on a task runner and some transformation tools to help us take care of business.

	Task Runner: Grunt? NPM? Gulp?
	Bundler: Parcel? Webpack?
	Transpiler: Babel - but, with Grunt or Webpack?

	There is a starting point set up in todo-app-base. It has all the HTML and css if you prefer not to write that yourself.

	Other branches related to this project are:

		- todo-app-start-point
		- todo-app-wip
