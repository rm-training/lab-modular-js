This is the "Time to the weekend" app

When a user clicks the button we will show them how much time is left until the weekend.

It includes a custom logging system which formats and logs output to the console.

It is styled with Bootstrap, though it does not use any Bootstrap JavaScript -- native ftw!

It uses momentjs to handle time and date dealings.
